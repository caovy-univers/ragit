# Rag'it!

Ragâ€™it is an exploratory project in digital humanities. It aims to build a knowledge graph from a multilingual colonial corpus drawn from the Indochinese legal deposit. It relies on natural language processing techniques applied to OCR-processed texts to identify concepts and semantic networks.

## Environment Setup for the RAGIT Project

This guide explains how to set up your Python environment to work with the RAGIT project, which uses **Poetry** for dependency management. Choose one of the three options below depending on your preferred setup tool: `venv`, `pyenv`, or `conda`.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python **3.12** installed (Poetry requires this version for this project)
- Poetry installed
  - [see installation instructions on the Poetry site](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

### 2. Environment Setup

#### Option 1: Using `venv` (standard Python virtual environment)

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

#### Option 2: Using `pyenv`

```bash
# Create ragit virtualenv with pyenv-virtualenv and set the local environment
pyenv install -s 3.12.9 && pyenv virtualenv 3.12.9 ragit && pyenv local ragit

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

#### Option 3: Using `conda`

```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n ragit python=3.12 -y && conda activate ragit

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

### 3. Additional Setup (RAG-specific installation instructions)

- Install and configure Ollama with Mistral:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

- Test your environment by running the RAG pipeline (in a separate terminal):

1. Start the model server with Ollama and keep the terminal  open:
```bash
ollama pull mistral
ollama run mistral
```

2. In a separate terminal, run the RAG pipeline in test mode:
```bash
poetry run python -m rag.main_pipeline --test
```

If this works, your environment is correctly configured. If you want to run the pipeline interactively, simply omit the `--test` flag. See the `README.md` file in `src/rag/` for more details.

### 4. Contributing

To manage project dependencies:

```bash
# Add a dependency
poetry add <package-name>

# Remove a dependency
poetry remove <package-name>
```
