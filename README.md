# Rag'it!

Ragâ€™it is an exploratory project in digital humanities. It aims to build a knowledge graph from a multilingual colonial corpus drawn from the Indochinese legal deposit. It relies on natural language processing techniques applied to OCR-processed texts to identify concepts and semantic networks.
